<p>So, as documented <a href="https://idea.junglecoder.com/view/idea/266">here</a>, I often find myself at a shell, wanting to bounce around without having to CD all over the place.</p>

<p>Turns out that doing that in CMD.exe is both easier, and harder than doing it in bash. Easier because I didn't end up busting out regular expressions and self-modifying scripts, harder because I ended up writing a seperate program for handling the <a href="https://idea.junglecoder.com/view/idea/275">jumplist database</a>, so that I could avoid doing that part of the file management in batch files, because I wasn't about to learn that much batch.</p>

<p>To get set up, build this <a href="https://idea.junglecoder.com/view/idea/275">go program</a> using the standard Go toolchain (I won't explain that in detail here), and install the resulting executable in your %PATH%.</p>

<p>Once you have that program (or an equivalent) installed on your path, you'll want to add create the following batch files on your path as well.</p>

<p>This will allow you to type things into CMD.exe like "<code>jadd MyProject</code>", and then, from another directory, type "<code>j MyProject</code>" to get back to the folder you marked.</p>

<h3>Usage:</h3>


<pre><code>jadd %MarkName%
</code></pre>

<p>Adds a mark to be able to jump to the current location</p>

<pre><code>jl
</code></pre>

<p>Lists out all the existing marks by name, and what directories they point to</p>

<pre><code>jrm %MarkName%
</code></pre>

<p>Removes the mark for the given mark name from the list of marks</p>

<pre><code>j %MarkName$
</code></pre>

<p>Jumps via CD to the directory for the given mark. The main use for this tool</p>
